function JOBFILE = camera_calibration_jobfile_01
% This function generates a job file containing the parameters needed to create a multi-camera calibration file.
% The output of this function should be used as an input to the function camera_calibration_01.m
% the stereo calibration plate of the form
%
%  x = f(X,Y,Z)
%  y = g(X,Y,Z)
%
% where (X,Y,Z) are the lab reference frame world coordinates (defined by
% the grid spacing in the calibration plate and its z traverse position)
% and (x,y) are the image coordinates of the grid points.  This function
% must first identify the image coordinates of the grid points and then
% correlate these points with the appropriate world coordinates.
