%This function is used to calculate the mutual information between two
%consecutive frames using SCC method
%   region 1 and 2 are the particle image within the interrogation window.
%   Sx and Sy are the correlation window size
%   fftindx and fftindy are fftshift indicies
%   We will first find the maximum intensity from the image, and average
%   particle diameter from particle image autocorrelation. A standard
%   gaussian particle is built based on these two parameter. Then the
%   contritbution of one particle is caluclate by take the auotcorrelatio
%   peak of stardard gaussian particle. The primary peak on correlation
%   plane is a summation of the contribution of all correlated particles.
%   MI is the ratio between contribution of all correlated particles and
%   one particle.

fg = INTS*exp(-8*((xco-round(Sx/2)).^2/(Diapx^2)+(yco-round(Sy/2)).^2/(Diapy^2))); % build the particle intensity distribution based on 2D Gaussian distribution

fg = fftn(fg,[Sy,Sx]); %FFT
Pg = fg.*conj(fg); %FFT based correlation
Sp = ifftn(Pg,'symmetric'); % convert to time domain
Sp = Sp(fftindy,fftindx); % Sp is the autocorrelation of the standadrd Gaussian particle
